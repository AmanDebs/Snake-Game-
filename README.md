# 🐍 Snake Game in Python (Turtle Graphics)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **classic Snake Game** built using Python's **turtle graphics** module.  
The goal is simple: eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or yourself.  

This project helped me practice:
- Python fundamentals  
- Loops, conditions, and functions  
- Event handling and animation with `turtle`  

---

## 🎮 Game Features
- Snake moves in 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right)  
- Food appears randomly on the screen  
- Score tracking system  
- Game over if the snake hits the wall or itself

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **turtle** (built-in library, no installation required)
